    <p>Nandi Hills (Anglicised forms include Nandidurg and Nandydoorg) is an ancient hill station built by Ganga Dynasty in the Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka state. It is 10 km from Chickballapur town and approximately 60 km from Bengaluru. The hills are near the town Nandi. In traditional belief, the hills are the origin of the Arkavathy river,[1] Ponnaiyar River, Palar River,[2] Papagni River and Penna River.[3] Watching the sunrise at Nandi Hills is popular with tourists.[4] The first ever SAARC summit hosted by India was held at Nandi Hills in 1986.[5]Nandi Hills (Anglicised forms include Nandidurg and Nandydoorg) is an ancient hill station built by Ganga Dynasty in the Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka state.
